<h4>{{=T('About Us')}}</h4>
<p>We are a group of Canadian entrepreneurs that got intriguedd by Google’s pretentious statement “We
want to index the world’s knowledge”, made us thinking if this is realistic or not. It could be, depending
from the perspective you are looking at what “world’s knowledge” is.</p>
<p>We can’t argue that everything that is printed information will escape Google’s tenacity over the next
several decades (yes, we are certain that the company will survive that long). But about everything else
that is not printed, that is tacit knowledge will disappear and never be recuperated again.</p>
<p>Just to quote Wikipedia “People are not often aware of the knowledge they possess or how it can be
valuable to others”.</p>
<p>Here is when we come in providing a simple but effective platform for people to share their experiences
in their own words. It is audio ONLY, so you can carry it with you everywhere on your iPod or phone.</p>
<p>Our goal is to learn from other people’s experiences either because we are hungry for knowledge or just
because we don’t want to make the same mistakes all over again.</p>
<p>It’s an Audio Storytelling, if you wish, one that is not told by actors, but by regular people.</p>
